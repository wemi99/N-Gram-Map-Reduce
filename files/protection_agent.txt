INTRODUCTION
This paper proposes a system protection scheme to
augment traditional backup relay methods in the
transmission system. Agents are used to give each
protection component its own thread of control as well
as the ability to communicate with others. This leads to
greater capabilities to self-check and self–correct. We
feel that this method naturally points towards a new
philosophy for backup protection. Simulations are used
to illustrate our concepts, using a simulation engine that
combines the EMTDC/PSCAD power simulator with the
NS2 network communications simulator. Results
illustrate the improved performance of our backup
protection scheme. Preliminary results give us hope that
the proposed protection scheme may be able to
contribute towards the mitigation of wide-area
disturbances and the power blackouts that frequently
follow.
BACKGROUND

during abnormal system events. This can lead to
catastrophic cascading events and can even cause
blackouts [2]. The ability for relays to self-check and
self-correct would be a significant addition to relays in
critical locations in the power system by allowing them
to reduce these hidden failures.
Backup relays are required to clear a fault when the
primary relay fails. Backup protection is usually made
up of step distance and step over-current relays. There
are two main drawbacks to this backup protection
scheme. First, it must be slow enough to coordinate with
all the associated relays. Second, the isolated region can
be much larger than it could be. In addition, the zone 3
backup relays sometimes operate incorrectly due to
heavy loads in abnormal system events and this
misoperation is the most familiar cause of cascading
outages. The longer time lag for fault clearance of zone3
backup relays is also a major cause of reduced power
system stability.

Relay misoperation, such as the failure to isolate a
faulted line or incorrectly tripping a healthy line, is
involved in major disturbances in the power system [1].
The primary protection systems for Extra-High Voltage
(> 230 kV) and High Voltage (> 35 kV) transmission
lines almost all rely on pilot relay schemes using
direction, phase comparison, or the longitudinal
difference principle. Many important relay research and
development efforts have been conducted over the years
resulting in improved primary relay performance and
fewer instances of relay misoperation[1]. However,
hidden failures still exist in the protection system,
causing relays to incorrectly remove unfaulted lines

Various backup protection systems based on either
expert systems or adaptive architectures have been
proposed in an attempt to correct for the traditional relay
systems’ shortcomings. Both types of schemes require
additional local and remote information [3-5]. In the
adaptive method, the setting of the zone 3 distance relay
was adapted to ensure optimized performance under
widely varying power system operating conditions. The
system used an integrated, hierarchical backup
protection scheme with a system computer, a substation
computer, and a number of distance relays. In a method
utilizing expert systems, a single computer was placed in
each substation where it was used to identify faulty lines
and to trip the circuit breakers when faults were found.

This paper describes an agent-based backup
protection scheme, where agents are embedded in each
of the conventional protection components to construct a

relay IED (Intelligent Electronic Device). The relay
agent searches for relevant information by
communicating with other relay agents. Agent
communications can take place at the same substation or
at remote substations. This information can be used to
detect relay misoperation and breaker failures and to
compensate for such problems with much better
performance than that can be done in traditional
schemes.

BACKUP

to that environment. An agent makes decisions without
the direct intervention of outside entities. This flexibility
and autonomy adds reliability to the protection system
because any given agent-based relay can continue to
work properly despite failures in other parts of the
protection system.

PROTECTION

(1) The Architecture of the Agent Relay
The keyword ‘agent ‘has been popularized in artificial
intelligence and systems research activities, but there is
still no single universally accepted definition about what
an agent is. In this paper, we consider an agent to be a
self-contained piece of software that has the properties
of autonomy and interaction.
A few proposals in the protection literature have
alternately used agents as components in a cooperative
protection system [6], a distributed intelligence in a
protection design [7], and an interactive, autonomous
software process in an adaptive multi-terminal line
protection system [8].
Our backup protection proposal uses geographically
distributed agents located in every relay IED shown in
Figure1 improving on the more traditional isolated
component system. In order to make this distributed
systems work effectively, the IEDs must be capable of
autonomously interacting with each other.

Figure 1: Backup Protection System
Our agent-based relays each have their own thread of
control, but read local sensors and communicate with
other agents (via LAN or via WAN) and act in response

Figure 2: The Relay IED Architecture
A natural way to combine legacy protection systems
with modern distributed information infrastructures is to
“wrap” the protection components with an agent layer
enabling them to interact with other agents and hence
other components [9]. Our agent relay IED’s, shown in
figure 2, illustrate this approach.
(2) A Description of the Communications System
Networked computing systems are becoming
increasingly prevalent in many areas and we believe that
this growth will occur within electric utility systems as
well. Technology is constantly changing, but we can
make some educated guesses about what such systems
will look like. First, the network systems will almost
certainly be built from off-the-shelf components. To do
otherwise would be expensive both in terms of initial
cost outlay and in system maintenance. This means that
these networks will be based on Internet standards even
if the systems remained independent of the global
network conglomeration. We can already see hints that
such changes are coming in recent standardization
efforts such as the Utility Communications Architecture
(UCA).
Communications protocols are methods for
transmitting data between networked computers. The
most popular low-level protocol in use on the Internet is
IP (the Internet Protocol). IP packages a data unit into an
entity known as a packet and makes a best-effort attempt
to deliver that packet to the intended destination. Besteffort here means that if a problem occurs in the delivery

attempt, perhaps because of network congestion, then the
packet will be lost. IP is rarely used by itself. Higherlevel protocols run on top of IP to provide added
functionality. The two most integral networking
protocols to IP-based networks such as the Internet are
the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User
Datagram Protocol (UDP). The Transmission Control
Protocol (TCP) is the more popular of the two. TCP’s
most notable contribution beyond IP’s functionality is its
ability to compensate for network losses by
retransmitting data until it has been received by its
intended destination. This is extremely valuable in many
cases, but it can have drawbacks in time-sensitive
situations since TCP delivers all data in a first-come
first-serve manner. That means that information that is
no longer relevant can stand in the way of current data if
packet losses become too great. The User Datagram
Protocol (UDP), by contrast, only makes minor additions
to IP. UDP’s best-effort delivery guarantees can be a
blessing in situations where data is only relevant for a
limited time. We have chosen to focus our initial
communication investigations on backup protection
systems using the UDP protocol for its nearly universal
support and low latency despite its lack of delivery

guarantees. We rely on traditional backup protection
behavior in the event of communication failure.
(3) The Strategy Employed by the Agent-Based Backup
Protection System
Relay agents monitor their corresponding relays and
take corrective actions when failures occur in the
protection system. An agent achieves this by searching
for relevant information within its transmission area and
then takes action based on the preset rules given in Table
1. The information gathered generally includes the
operational responses of conventional relays and circuit
breakers’ status. However, it may sometimes also
include currents and voltages. A relay agents’
transmission region generally consists of the
transmission lines included in its primary and backup
protection zones as well as those lines whose backup
protection zones cover the current line. An agent can
either receive the list of agents, which are in its
transmission area and with which it will communicate, at
initialization or it might learn this information through
some type of network topology discovery algorithm.

Method]

As shown as in Table 1 Rule 1, when an agent
observes a primary relay trip, the agent will check the
status of its own zone 3 relays and will communicate
with agents in its region to find their zone 3 relay status.
The trip operation of the primary relay is considered to
be correct if most of the zone 3 relays operate, or
incorrect when none of the zone 3 relays operate.
Otherwise, the situation is uncertain and the agent will
search for additional information such as the local and
remote currents and voltages. A differential measure is
used to locate the fault. The primary relay trip is correct
if a fault is found on its primary protection zone or is
misoperating if that is not the case.
If a primary relay trip has occurred and it is operating
correctly or if a fault is confirmed in the primary
protection zone then the agent will try to clear the fault
in as small a region as is practicable. The agent takes
note of breaker trip signal events. It then waits until the
breaker clearance time has passed. If the breaker is still
closed at that time then the agent will send trip message
to all other agents in the area surrounding the fault in
order to clear it. These agents will send trip signals to
their breakers and will then initiate their respective
breaker failure supervision routines. This process
continues until the fault is cleared. In this way, the agent
system provides fast backup protection with a high
selectivity.
The agent-based protection system has many benefits
over traditional systems. As shown as in Table 1, zone 3
relays can be monitored allowing corrections to prevent
false breaker trips. This correction has the potential to
greatly reduce the number of incorrect trips in cases
where there is a heavy load. In addition, in the case of
both primary and local backup relay failure, the agent
can locate the faulted line using notification messages
and can send a trip signal to potentially only clear the
faulted line. Traditional backup systems clear such faults
using remote backup relays with a bigger isolated region
and with a greater delay time. If an incorrect primary
relay trip is found by the agent then a block signal can be
sent to stop an unwarranted breaker trip. Breaker failure
protection trips all breakers connected in the same bus in
most bus arrangements and induces a big disturbance.
The reliability gains can be significant in those cases.
In summary, our agent-based backup protection
system has the ability to self-check, self-correct, and
achieves highly selective and fast backup functions when
primary protection or circuit breakers fail. To illustrate
the agent’s advantages, we will look at an example
involving transmission line MN in Figure 3.

CASE STUDY
We created two experiments to illustrate the
advantages of our agent-based backup protection system.
Experiments were run using EPOCHS [13], a simulator
that combines the PSCAD/EMTDC transient simulation
environment [11] with the NS2 network communication
simulator [12]. We designed the agents and their
supporting infrastructure using an object-oriented
approach. All experiments revolved around the 400 kV
example system shown in Figure 3.
The simulation was simplified by only considering
three-phase faults and by using the zone 1 distance relay
as primary protection. The transmission network is
equipped with an agent-based backup protection system.
Any agent can communicate with any other agent. The
emittances of current transformers, voltage transformers,
and anti-aliasing filters are included and the DFT is used
to obtain inputs needed for mho distance relays. Both
distance and time delay relays have been placed into
operation with traditional settings. The tests include an
incorrect operation of a zone 1 relay and a breaker
failure. All experiments assume that the power system
begins operation at time 0.
Agent communication was simplified to the most
basic level. We assumed that there is a 1 ms delay
between each bus and that there is no network
congestion. Agent messages consisted of either requests
for voltage, current, and relay status, breaker set
requests, or replies to those requests.

Figure 3: The example power system
(1) Case I: Primary Relay Misoperation
In the first experiment, a zone1 relay misoperation
occurs at time 0.2 seconds. The simulation results are
shown in Figure4. It can be seen that there is a block
signal sent by the relay agent 5 to breaker 5 near time
0.2 seconds, preventing the breaker trip initiated by the
incorrect operation of relay zone 1. The resulting phase
A current can be seen in Figure 4(c). Had the agents not
been in the system, the phase A current would look like
Figure 4(d).

(2) Case II: Break Failures Occur
In the second experiment, a fault is located at the
midpoint of line MN and is schedule to occur at time 0.3
seconds as can be seen in Figure 5(d). Moreover, after a
fault occurs at time of 0.3 seconds, the relay 5 agent
monitors the line to ensure the correct operation of zone
1. It perceives a breaker 5 failure when the setting time
is longer than the breaker clearing time. The agent will
react by sending a trip message to agent 4 (see Figure
5(b)), which initiates a signal to breaker 4 to clear the
fault. However, breaker 4 is faulty leading to another
message from agent 4 to agent 3 as shown in Figure 5(c).
Agent 3 finally sends a signal to breaker 3 to clear the
fault. The phase A current values for the entire
experiment can be seen in Figure 5(d). However, much
more time is needed for the fault to be cleared in remote
zone 3 in the same situation without the agent system, as
shown in Figure 6.

Figure 5: Both breakers 4 and 5 fail when a fault occurs
at time 0.3 seconds. The agent-based backup protection
system clears the fault in just a little additional time
beyond twice the breaker clearing time.

Figure 4: In this experiment, a primary relay
misoperates at time 0.2 as can be seen in (a). The agentbased backup protection system responds to the failure
(b) and does not open the breaker resulting in (c). The
traditional system responds by opening the breaker (d).

Figure 6: This is the same situation as in Figure 5
without the agent-based protection system. It takes a
traditional zone 3 backup system more than 1.5 seconds
to clear the fault remotely.

CONCLUSION
In this paper we developed a backup protection
system that improves on the traditional trip zone while
simultaneously decreasing clearing times. We have
introduced a distributed architecture based on interactive
autonomous agents. The agents embedded in each relay
IED all communicate with other relay agents in order to
check the status of relays, locate fault lines, and to
minimize the isolated region when primary protection
systems or circuit breakers fail. Experimental results
show that this technique has promise and we hope to
refine our ideas in future work where we plan to explore
the expected communication traffic patterns and to make
our agents more intelligent and robust towards network
conditions.
